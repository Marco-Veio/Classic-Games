Objective:
	Guess the 4-color-combination generated by the computer. To do that, you have 10 tries.
How to play:
	Type the numbers equivalents to the colors:
	1 - Blue
	2 - Green
	3 - Cyan
	4 - Red
	5 - Magenta
	6 - Brown
	7 - Yellow
	8 - Dark grey
	9 - Bright blue
	Not all the colors will be available (you can choose the quantity of colors). After typing 4 colors, you will
	get a feedback with black and grey squares. The black ones mean that you guessed the color and the position
	correctly, and the grey squares mean that you guessed only the color correctly.
Difficulties:
	Easy: The combination doesn't have repeated colors
	Hard: The combination may have repeated colors
