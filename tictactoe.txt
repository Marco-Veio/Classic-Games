Objective: 
	Place 3 equal marks in a vertical, horizontal or diagonal row, as the following examples:
	 O | O | O 			 X |   |			 O |   |
  	---+---+---			---+---+---			---+---+---
	   |   |   			 X |   |   			   | O |   		
  	---+---+---			---+---+---			---+---+---
	   |   |   			 X |   |   			   |   | O 
	If both players fail to reach the objective, it's a draw.
How to play:
	You choose a position to place your mark, unless it was already chosen. At the same time, you need to
	reach the objective and not let the opponent do the same. 
Difficulties:
	Easy: Computer chooses any position
	Medium: Computer tries to win, but it doesn't use any tricks
	Hard: Computer uses tricks to win and it can't lose
